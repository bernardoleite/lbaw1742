# A1: SHOWCHAN

The goal of this project is to provide tv show and movie aficionados with daily news and updates of this media. This very system will be community-based since only registered members are allowed to both rate and comment each other's submissions, triggering healthy discussions.  

A vital feature of the system is the user's capability of submitting its own news and rating other posts. Submissions are ordered by both user rating and post date, thus being possible for a client to directly influence a news article's exposure, whilst keeping the top submissions fresh.

We believe most popular websites that provide this sort of service do not only focus on news themselves (e.g. Reddit and 4chan), but instead allow an assortment of themes. Our goal is to apply their success formula in a more concrete context.

The platform aims to be highly interactive, as multiple users vote on eachother's submissions; have clean and adaptive interface, across multiple devices; and provide a straightforward user experience, relying on pertinent keyboard shortcuts. It'll also feature a search engine with various filter options - sort by date, popularity, topic, domain, etc.

We've nailed down four main user permissions - visitor, member, moderator and administrator. A visitor may simply read articles, not being able to interact with them in any way. A registered member has the possibility of creating its own posts and provide feedback to other submissions by commenting and rating. A moderator has every permission described thus far plus the ability to remove submissions and comments which do not follow the website's guidelines. The platform's administrator has every privilege a moderator has plus the tools to assign the moderator role to any user. Beyond this, the processes of adding, editing and deleting members (and their privileges) are important functions enabled for the administrator. Lastly, some advanced features of this entity undergo members customization profile display settings, analyze site usage data with monitoring tools on website, implement updates, upgrades, resolve usability issues and standardize levels of access and security.
